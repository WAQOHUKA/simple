        <p style="color: #c53b3b;"><sup>M</sup>aseno University founded in 1991, is the only  <bold>university</bold> on the globe that lies along the Equator (00). It is one of the original seven  universities in Kenya. It has a number of campuses namely; Main Campus situated in  Maseno Township along Kisumu-Busia road, 25 km from Kisumu City and approximately 400 km west of Nairobi the capital city of Kenya, Kisumu Campus, Odera Akang'o in Siaya County and the eCampus.

            <mark>Maseno</mark> University currently has one  Campus,(Kisumu Campus). Maseno Main Campus is in Maseno Township 25km from Kisumu on the Busia road. The core activities and central administration of the University takes place on this Campus. The eCampus is one of the latest innovations by Maseno University to facilitate online delivery of high quality certificate, diploma and degree programmes to learners in various parts of the country, the East African region and beyond. All programmes offered at the eCampus are primarily delivered through the internet, with students taking online examinations at the end of each Semester. Kisumu Campus is within the Central Business District of Kisumu City and is exclusively served by a spacious parking yard situated directly opposite Kisumu Hotel (Maseno University).
            
            The name "Maseno" was coined by Rev. J.J. Willis out of the name of a tree known in local dialects as "Oseno" or "Oluseno" that stood next to the spot where the first missionaries in the region erected their base.
            
            Maseno University’s history begun with the merging of Maseno Government Training Institute (GTI) with Siriba Teacher’s Training College to form Maseno University College as a Constituent College of Moi University. This led to its subsequent gazetting in October 1990 crowning the two institutions’ several decades of meritorious existence. It became a full-fledged University 11 years later, in 2001.</p>
